# Wordle Solver

Wordle Solver is a Java-based application designed to help you crack Wordle puzzles faster. By analyzing clues from your Wordle guesses, the solver suggests possible words to narrow down the answer. Whether you're a casual fan looking to improve your game or a developer interested in algorithm design, this project is a great starting point!

## Features

- **Automated Word Suggestions:** Quickly generate a list of possible words based on your clues.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** Simple command-line or IDE-based interaction for testing various inputs.
- **Modular Codebase:** Clean and well-organized project structure that makes it easy to extend or modify.
- **Educational Purpose:** Explore how algorithms can be applied to solve puzzles like Wordle.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java JDK:** Ensure you have Java 8 or later installed. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
- **Eclipse IDE (or any Java IDE):** The project is set up with Eclipse-specific configuration files (`.classpath`, `.project`, and `.settings`). However, you can import it into any IDE that supports Java.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nayemislamzr/wordle-solver.git
   cd wordle-solver
   ```

2. **Import the Project into Your IDE:**

   - **Eclipse:**
     - Open Eclipse and select **File > Import... > Existing Projects into Workspace**.
     - Browse to the cloned repository and import the project.
   - **Other IDEs:**
     - Create a new Java project and copy the contents of the `src` directory into your projectâ€™s source folder. Adjust build paths as necessary.

3. **Build the Project:**

   - If using Eclipse, the project should build automatically.
   - Otherwise, compile the Java files from the command line:

     ```bash
     javac -d bin src/**/*.java
     ```

### Usage

Once the project is built, you can run the solver application. For example, if you have a `Main.java` in your `src` folder, execute it:

```bash
java -cp bin your.package.name.Main
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your Wordle clues and receive word suggestions.
